The Face Recognition and Detection System uses the OpenCV library to perform image processing and computer vision tasks. It offers two key functionalities: detecting faces in static images and live face detection using a webcam.

For image-based face detection, the system processes images to identify faces using a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`). Detected faces are highlighted with rectangles, and the processed image is either displayed or saved for further use.

For live face detection, the system utilizes a webcam to capture video frames in real time. Each frame is analyzed using the Haar cascade classifier to detect faces, which are marked with rectangles. The live detection continues seamlessly until the user presses the 'q' key to exit the application.

This system effectively demonstrates the capabilities of OpenCV in detecting and recognizing faces, offering a practical solution for both static and real-time scenarios.
