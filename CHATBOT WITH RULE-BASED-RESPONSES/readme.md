This project is about creating a simple rule-based chatbot in Python. The chatbot responds to various user inputs, such as greetings, questions about its identity, jokes, or weather inquiries. It works by detecting specific keywords or phrases in the user's message and generating predefined responses accordingly. The code uses basic Python functions to capture user input, process it with conditional statements, and provide the appropriate reply. Users can interact with the chatbot as much as they'd like, and when theyâ€™re ready to end the conversation, they simply type "bye." The chatbot can be expanded and customized to add more features and improve its responses.
